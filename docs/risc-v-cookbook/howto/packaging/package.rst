Packaging binaries as ``.deb``
==============================

To package binaries produced by source code as a ``.deb`` file, the build system must be adapted
to generate a ``.deb`` instead of raw binaries. This is achieved by using a Debian build tool,
such as ``dpkg-buildpackage``, to build the source code instead of the original build system.

The ``dpkg-buildpackage`` tool acts as a wrapper around the original build system and relies on
a ``debian/`` folder in the root directory of the source code. This folder contains metadata and
configuration files required to produce ``.deb`` files. These tools utilize this information to
organize the binaries generated by the original build system into one or more ``.deb`` files in
a standardized format.

Steps to package binaries as ``.deb``
-------------------------------------

1. Download the upstream source as a tarball:

   .. code:: none

      wget http://www.example.org/download/debhello-0.0.tar.gz

2. Rename the tarball to ``<source_package>_<upstream_version>.orig.tar.gz`` (e.g., ``debhello_0.0.orig.tar.gz``).

3. Untar the tarball:

   .. code:: none

      tar -xzmf debhello_0.0.orig.tar.gz

4. Rename the untarred directory to ``<source_package>-<upstream_version>`` (e.g., ``debhello-0.0``).

5. Install the ``debmake`` tool:

   .. code:: none

      sudo apt install debmake

6. Generate the ``debian/`` folder.

   Switch to the directory (e.g., ``debhello-0.0``) and run ``debmake``, this creates the ``debian/`` folder:

   .. code:: none

      cd debhello-0.0
      debmake

7. Customize the ``debian/`` folder.

   The ``debian/`` directory must now include templates for essential files. Among those are:

   - ``debian/control``: Metadata about the package, such as its name, section, description, dependencies,
     and maintainer. See the `Debian Policy Manual: Control Files 
     <https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#debian-source-package-template-control-files-debian-control>`_
     for detailed information.

   - ``debian/copyright``: Copyright details of the package. By default, ``debmake`` creates it in the
     `DEP-5 format <https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/>`_.

   - ``debian/rules``: A Makefile-style script specifying how to build the package. For more details, see
     :ref:`customizing_debian_rules`.

   - ``debian/changelog``: History of changes to the package. This can be edited manually or with the
     ``dch`` tool. After installation, it is stored at ``/usr/share/doc/<package>/changelog.Debian.gz``.

   Customize the above files and remove unused ones to match your package requirements. A minimal ``debian/`` could look like:

   .. code-block:: none

        debian/
        ├── changelog
        ├── control
        ├── copyright
        ├── gbp.conf
        ├── rules*
        ├── source/
        │   └── format
        ├── tests/
        │   └── control
        └── watch

8. Build the package.

   Run the following commands to build the package locally:

   .. code:: bash

      dpkg-buildpackage

   To skip signing the package, use:

   .. code:: bash

      dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

   For instructions on building for a PPA, see :doc:`Upload to a PPA <../launchpad/upload_ppa>` instead.

.. _customizing_debian_rules:

Customizing ``debian/rules``
----------------------------

The ``dpkg-buildpackage`` command uses the ``debian/rules`` file to build ``.deb`` packages. This
file can be as simple as:

.. code-block:: makefile

   #!/usr/bin/make -f
   #export DH_VERBOSE = 1

   %:
       dh $@

The ``dh`` commands belong to the :pkg:`debhelper` suite, which automates common packaging tasks.
For more information, see the `debhelper manual
<https://manpages.debian.org/testing/debhelper/debhelper.7.en.html>`_. Debhelper attempts to
detect the build system (e.g., Autotools, CMake, Python ``setup.py``, etc.) based on source files
and configures the build steps accordingly.

If autodetection fails, specific steps can be overridden in ``debian/rules``, e.g.:

.. code-block:: makefile

      override_dh_auto_configure:
          ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-feature

      override_dh_auto_build:
          make -j4
